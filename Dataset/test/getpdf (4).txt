4. First Aid Measures
General Information: Immediately remove any clothing contaminated by the product. Move out of
dangerous area. Consult a physician and show this safety data sheet.
Inhalation: Move person to fresh air. If not breathing, give artificial respiration. If breathing is
difficult, give oxygen. Obtain medical aid.
Skin contact: Immediately flush skin with running water for at least 15 minutes while removing
contaminated clothing and shoes. Wash clothing before reuse. Obtain medical aid immediately.
Eye contact: Immediately flush open eyes with running water for at least 15 minutes. Obtain medical
aid immediately.

Ingestion: Do NOT induce vomiting without medical advice. Rinse mouth with water. Never
administer anything by mouth to an unconscious person. Obtain medical aid immediately.
Most important symptoms and effects, both acute and delayed: No further information
available. Please see sections 2 and 11.
Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed: No further
information available.
5. Fire Fighting Measures
Suitable extinguishing media: Use water spray, dry chemical, carbon dioxide, or chemical foam.
Specific hazards arising from the chemical: Calcium oxides.
Advice for firefighters: As in any fire, wear a NIOSH-approved or equivalent, pressure-demand,
self-contained breathing apparatus and full protective gear. During a fire, irritating and highly toxic
gases may be generated by thermal decomposition or combustion.
6. Accidental Release Measures
Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures: Wear protective
equipment and keep unprotected personnel away. Ensure adequate ventilation. Remove all sources of
ignition. Prevent further leak or spill if safe to do so. For personal protective equipment, please refer to
section 8.
Environmental precautions: Do not let product enter drains, other waterways, or soil.
Methods and materials for containment and cleaning up: Prevent further leak or spill if safe to
do so. Vacuum, sweep up, or absorb with inert material and place into a suitable disposal container.
Consult local regulations for disposal. See section 13 for further disposal information.
7. Handling and Storage
Precautions for safe handling: Avoid contact with skin, eyes, and personal clothing. Wash hands
thoroughly after handling. Avoid breathing fumes. Use only with adequate ventilation. Wear suitable
protective clothing, gloves, and eye/face protection. Keep away from sources of ignition. Minimize dust
generation and accumulation. Keep container tightly closed. Open and handle container with care. Do
not eat, drink, or smoke while handling.
Conditions for safe storage, including any incompatibilities: Store in a tightly-closed
container when not in use. Store in a cool, dry, well-ventilated area away from incompatible substances.
Keep away from sources of ignition. ,Store long-term in a cool, dry place.
8. Exposure Controls/Personal Protection
Exposure limits:
OSHA PEL: Not available.
NIOSH REL: Not available.
ACGIH TLV: Not available.
Appropriate engineering controls: Avoid contact with skin, eyes, and clothing. Wash hands before
breaks and immediately after handling the product. Facilities storing or utilizing this material should be
equipped with an eyewash fountain. Use adequate general and local exhaust ventilation to keep airborne
concentrations low.
Personal protection
Eyes: Based on an evaluation of the eye or face hazards present, wear chemical splash-resistant
safety glasses or goggles with side protection. A face shield may be appropriate in some
workplaces. Use eyewear tested and approved under appropriate government standards
such as OSHA 29 CFR 1910.133 or EU EN166.

Hands: Wear gloves selected based on an evaluation of the possible hazards to hands and skin,
the duration of use, the physical conditions of the workplace, and the chemical resistance
and physical properties of the glove material.
Skin and body: Protective clothing must be selected based on the hazards present in the workplace, the
physical environment, the duration of exposure, and other factors. No fabric can provide
protection against all potential hazards; therefore it is important to select the appropriate
protective clothing for each specific hazard. At the minimum, wear a laboratory coat and
close-toed footwear.
Respiratory: Respirators are not a substitute for accepted engineering control measures such as
enclosure or confinement of the operation, general and local ventilation, and substitution
of less toxic materials. When respiratory personal protective equipment is appropriate
based on an assessment of respiratory hazards in the workplace, use a NIOSH- or
CEN-certified respirator.
