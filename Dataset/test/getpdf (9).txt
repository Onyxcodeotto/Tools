After inhalation:
Move exposed individual to fresh air. Loosen clothing as necessary and position individual in a comfortable
position. Seek medical advice if discomfort or irritation persists. If breathing difficult, give oxygen.
After skin contact:
Wash affected area with soap and water. Rinse thoroughly. Seek medical attention if irritation, discomfort or
vomiting persists.
After eye contact:
Protect unexposed eye. Rinse/flush exposed eye(s) gently using water for 15-20 minutes. Remove contact
lens(es) if able to do so during rinsing. Seek medical attention if irritation persists or if concerned.
After swallowing:
Rinse mouth thoroughly. Do not induce vomiting. Have exposed individual drink sips of water. Seek medical
attention if irritation, discomfort or vomiting persists.

Skin, eye, and upper respiratory tract irritation. Irritation. Nausea. Headache. Shortness of breath.
Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed:
If seeking medical attention, provide SDS document to physician.
SECTION 5: Firefighting measures
Extinguishing media
Suitable extinguishing agents:
If in laboratory setting, follow laboratory fire suppression procedures. Use appropriate fire suppression agents
for adjacent combustible materials or sources of ignition.
Unsuitable extinguishing agents:
Carbon Dioxide.
Special hazards arising from the substance or mixture:
Combustion products may include carbon oxides or other toxic vapors. Thermal decomposition can lead to
release of irritating gases and vapors. Avoid generating dust; fine dust dispersed in air in sufficient
concentrations, and in the presence of an ignition source is a potential dust explosion hazard. Calcium Oxide.
Advice for firefighters:
Protective equipment:
Use NIOSH-approved respiratory protection/breathing apparatus.
Additional information (precautions):
Move product containers away from fire or keep cool with water spray as a protective measure, where feasible.
Use spark-proof tools and explosion-proof equipment.
SECTION 6: Accidental release measures
Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures:
Wear protective equipment. Transfer to a disposal or recovery container. Use spark-proof tools and explosion-
proof equipment. Use respiratory protective device against the effects of fumes/dust/aerosol. Keep unprotected
persons away. Ensure adequate ventilation. Keep away from ignition sources. Protect from heat. Stop the spill,
if possible. Contain spilled material by diking or using inert absorbent.
Environmental precautions:
Prevent from reaching drains, sewer or waterway. Collect contaminated soil for characterization per Section 13.
Methods and material for containment and cleaning up:
If in a laboratory setting, follow Chemical Hygiene Plan procedures. Collect liquids using vacuum or by use of
absorbents. Place into properly labeled containers for recovery or disposal. If necessary, use trained response
staff/contractor. Dust deposits should not be allowed to accumulate on surfaces, as these may form an
explosive mixture if they are released into the atmosphere in sufficient concentration. Avoid dispersal of dust in
the air (i.e., clearing dust surfaces with compressed air).
Reference to other sections: None
SECTION 7: Handling and storage
Precautions for safe handling:
Minimize dust generation and accumulation. Wash hands after handling. Avoid dispersal of dust in the air (i.e.,
clearing dust surfaces with compressed air). Routine housekeeping should be instituted to ensure that dusts do
not accumulate on surfaces. Dry powders can build static electricity charges when subjected to the friction of
transfer and mixing operations. Follow good hygiene procedures when handling chemical materials. Do not eat,
drink, smoke, or use personal products when handling chemical substances. If in a laboratory setting, follow
Chemical Hygiene Plan. Use only in well ventilated areas. Avoid generation of dust or fine particulate. Avoid
contact with eyes, skin, and clothing.

Conditions for safe storage, including any incompatibilities:
Store in a cool location. Provide ventilation for containers. Avoid storage near extreme heat, ignition sources or
open flame. Store away from foodstuffs. Store away from oxidizing agents. Store in cool, dry conditions in well
sealed containers. Keep container tightly sealed.
SECTION 8: Exposure controls/personal protection
Control Parameters: 1305-62-0, Calcium hydroxide, NIOSH REL: TWA 5 mg/m3.
1305-62-0, Calcium hydroxide, ACGIH TLV TWA 5 mg/m3.
1305-62-0, Calcium hydroxide, OSHA PEL TWA: 15 mg/m3 (total dust).
1305-62-0, Calcium hydroxide, OSHA PEL TWA: 5 mg/m3 (respirable
fraction).
Appropriate Engineering controls: Emergency eye wash fountains and safety showers should be available in
the immediate vicinity of use/handling. Provide exhaust ventilation or
other engineering controls to keep the airborne concentrations of vapor
or dusts (total/respirable) below the applicable workplace exposure limits
(Occupational Exposure Limits-OELs) indicated above. Use under a fume
hood. It is recommended that all dust control equipment such as local
exhaust ventilation and material transport systems involved in handling
of this product contain explosion relief vents or an explosion suppression
system or an oxygen deficient environment. Ensure that dust-handling
systems (such as exhaust ducts, dust collectors, vessels, and processing
equipment) are designed in a manner to prevent the escape of dust into
the work area (i.e., there is no leakage from the equipment).
Respiratory protection: Not required under normal conditions of use. Use suitable respiratory
protective device when high concentrations are present. Use suitable
respiratory protective device when aerosol or mist is formed. For spills,
respiratory protection may be advisable.
Protection of skin: The glove material has to be impermeable and resistant to the product/
the substance/ the preparation being used/handled. Selection of the glove
material on consideration of the penetration times, rates of diffusion and
the degradation.
Eye protection: Safety glasses with side shields or goggles.
General hygienic measures: The usual precautionary measures are to be adhered to when handling
chemicals. Keep away from food, beverages and feed sources.
Immediately remove all soiled and contaminated clothing. Wash hands
before breaks and at the end of work. Do not inhale
gases/fumes/dust/mist/vapor/aerosols. Avoid contact with the eyes and
skin.
