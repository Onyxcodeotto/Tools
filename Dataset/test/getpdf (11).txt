Precautionary 
statements
Prevention: Wash face, hands, and any exposed skin thoroughly after 
handling. Wear protective gloves/protective clothing/eye protection/face 
protection. Use only outdoors or in a well-ventilated area. Do not breathe 
dust/fume/gas/mist/vapors/spray.
IF INHALED: Remove victim to fresh air and keep at rest in a position 
comfortable for breathing. Call a POISON CENTER or doctor/physician if you 
feel unwell.
IF ON SKIN (or hair): Take off immediately all contaminated clothing. Rinse 
skin with water/shower. Wash contaminated clothing before reuse. 
Immediately call a POISON CENTER or doctor/physician.
IF IN EYES: Rinse cautiously with water for several minutes. Remove contact 
lenses, if present and easy to do. Continue rinsing. Immediately call a 
POISON CENTER or doctor/physician.
IF SWALLOWED: Rinse mouth. DO NOT induce vomiting.
Storage: Store in a well-ventilated place. Keep container tightly closed. Store 
locked up.

Laballey.com Page 3 of 10
4.1 Description of first-aid measures
General advice
If inhaled Remove to fresh air. If not breathing, give artificial respiration. Get medical 
attention if symptoms occur.
In case of skin contact                     :Wash off immediately with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes. Immediate 
medical attention is required.
In case of eye contact                      :Rinse immediately with plenty of water, also under the eyelids, for at least 15 
minutes. Get medical attention.
If swallowed Do NOT induce vomiting. Call a physician or poison control center 
immediately.
4.2 Most important symptoms and effects, both acute and delayed
Causes severe skin burns and eye damage.
4.3 Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed
If symptoms persist, call a physician. Treat symptomatically.
SECTION 5: Firefighting measures
5.1 Extinguishing media
Suitable extinguishing media Substance is nonflammable; use agent most
appropriate to extinguish surrounding fire.
Unsuitable extinguishing mediaCarbon dioxide (CO2).
5.2 Specific hazards arising from the substance or mixture
Non-combustible. Contact with metals may evolve flammable hydrogen gas. Thermal 
decomposition can lead to release of irritating gases and vapors. 
Hazardous Combustion Products: Calcium oxides.
5.3 Special protective equipment and precautions for firefighters
As in any fire, wear self-contained breathing apparatus pressure-demand, MSHA/NIOSH 
(approved or equivalent) and full protective gear.
