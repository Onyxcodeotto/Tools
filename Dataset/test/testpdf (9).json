Use appropriate fire suppression agents\r\nfor adjacent combustible materials or sources of ignition.\r\nUnsuitable extinguishing agents:\r\nCarbon Dioxide.\r\nSpecial hazards arising from the substance or mixture:\r\nCombustion products may include carbon oxides or other toxic vapors. Thermal decomposition can lead to\r\nrelease of irritating gases and vapors. Avoid generating dust; fine dust dispersed in air in sufficient\r\nconcentrations, and in the presence of an ignition source is a potential dust explosion hazard. Calcium Oxide.\r\nAdvice for firefighters:\r\nProtective equipment:\r\nUse NIOSH-approved respiratory protection/breathing apparatus.\r\nAdditional information (precautions):\r\nMove product containers away from fire or keep cool with water spray as a protective measure, where feasible.\r\nUse spark-proof tools and explosion-proof equipment.\r\nSECTION 6: Accidental release measures\r\nPersonal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures:\r\nWear protective equipment. Transfer to a disposal or recovery container. Use spark-proof tools and explosion-\r\nproof equipment. Use respiratory protective device against the effects of fumes/dust/aerosol. Keep unprotected\r\npersons away. Ensure adequate ventilation. Keep away from ignition sources. Protect from heat. Stop the spill,\r\nif possible. Contain spilled material by diking or using inert absorbent.\r\nEnvironmental precautions:\r\nPrevent from reaching drains, sewer or waterway. Collect contaminated soil for characterization per Section 13.\r\nMethods and material for containment and cleaning up:\r\nIf in a laboratory setting, follow Chemical Hygiene Plan procedures. Collect liquids using vacuum or by use of\r\nabsorbents. Place into properly labeled containers for recovery or disposal. If necessary, use trained response\r\nstaff/contractor. Dust deposits should not be allowed to accumulate on surfaces, as these may form an\r\nexplosive mixture if they are released into the atmosphere in sufficient concentration. Avoid dispersal of dust in\r\nthe air (i.e., clearing dust surfaces with compressed air).\r\nReference to other sections: None\r\nSECTION 7: Handling and storage\r\nPrecautions for safe handling:\r\nMinimize dust generation and accumulation. Wash hands after handling. Avoid dispersal of dust in the air (i.e.,\r\nclearing dust surfaces with compressed air). Routine housekeeping should be instituted to ensure that dusts do\r\nnot accumulate on surfaces. Dry powders can build static electricity charges when subjected to the friction of\r\ntransfer and mixing operations. Follow good hygiene procedures when handling chemical materials. Do not eat,\r\ndrink, smoke, or use personal products when handling chemical substances. If in a laboratory setting, follow\r\nChemical Hygiene Plan. Use only in well ventilated areas. Avoid generation of dust or fine particulate. Avoid\r\ncontact with eyes, skin, and clothing.\r\nSafety Data Sheet\r\naccording to 29CFR1910/1200 and GHS Rev. 3\r\nEffective date : 12.14.2014 Page 4 of 8\r\nCalcium Hydroxide,\r\nCreated by Global Safety Management, 1-813-435-5161 - www.GSMSDS.com\r\nConditions for safe storage, including any incompatibilities:\r\nStore in a cool location.

Store in cool, dry conditions in well\r\nsealed containers. Keep container tightly sealed.\r\nSECTION 8: Exposure controls/personal protection\r\nControl Parameters: 1305-62-0, Calcium hydroxide, NIOSH REL: TWA 5 mg/m3.\r\n1305-62-0, Calcium hydroxide, ACGIH TLV TWA 5 mg/m3.\r\n1305-62-0, Calcium hydroxide, OSHA PEL TWA: 15 mg/m3 (total dust).\r\n1305-62-0, Calcium hydroxide, OSHA PEL TWA: 5 mg/m3 (respirable\r\nfraction).\r\nAppropriate Engineering controls: Emergency eye wash fountains and safety showers should be available in\r\nthe immediate vicinity of use/handling. Provide exhaust ventilation or\r\nother engineering controls to keep the airborne concentrations of vapor\r\nor dusts (total/respirable) below the applicable workplace exposure limits\r\n(Occupational Exposure Limits-OELs) indicated above. Use under a fume\r\nhood. It is recommended that all dust control equipment such as local\r\nexhaust ventilation and material transport systems involved in handling\r\nof this product contain explosion relief vents or an explosion suppression\r\nsystem or an oxygen deficient environment. Ensure that dust-handling\r\nsystems (such as exhaust ducts, dust collectors, vessels, and processing\r\nequipment) are designed in a manner to prevent the escape of dust into\r\nthe work area (i.e., there is no leakage from the equipment).\r\nRespiratory protection: Not required under normal conditions of use. Use suitable respiratory\r\nprotective device when high concentrations are present. Use suitable\r\nrespiratory protective device when aerosol or mist is formed. For spills,\r\nrespiratory protection may be advisable.\r\nProtection of skin: The glove material has to be impermeable and resistant to the product/\r\nthe substance/ the preparation being used/handled. Selection of the glove\r\nmaterial on consideration of the penetration times, rates of diffusion and\r\nthe degradation.\r\nEye protection: Safety glasses with side shields or goggles.\r\nGeneral hygienic measures: The usual precautionary measures are to be adhered to when handling\r\nchemicals.
