First Aid Measures\r\nGeneral Information: Immediately remove any clothing contaminated by the product. Move out of\r\ndangerous area. Consult a physician and show this safety data sheet.\r\nInhalation: Move person to fresh air. If not breathing, give artificial respiration. If breathing is\r\ndifficult, give oxygen. Obtain medical aid.\r\nSkin contact: Immediately flush skin with running water for at least 15 minutes while removing\r\ncontaminated clothing and shoes. Wash clothing before reuse. Obtain medical aid immediately.\r\nEye contact: Immediately flush open eyes with running water for at least 15 minutes. Obtain medical\r\naid immediately.\r\nAK Scientific, Inc.\r\nSafety Data Sheet (United States)\r\nCalcium hydroxide, ACS, 95.0% min.\r\nPage 1 of 4\r\nIngestion: Do NOT induce vomiting without medical advice. Rinse mouth with water. Never\r\nadminister anything by mouth to an unconscious person. Obtain medical aid immediately.\r\nMost important symptoms and effects, both acute and delayed: No further information\r\navailable. Please see sections 2 and 11.\r\nIndication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed: No further\r\ninformation available.\r\n5. Fire Fighting Measures\r\nSuitable extinguishing media: Use water spray, dry chemical, carbon dioxide, or chemical foam.\r\nSpecific hazards arising from the chemical: Calcium oxides.\r\nAdvice for firefighters: As in any fire, wear a NIOSH-approved or equivalent, pressure-demand,\r\nself-contained breathing apparatus and full protective gear. During a fire, irritating and highly toxic\r\ngases may be generated by thermal decomposition or combustion.\r\n6. Accidental Release Measures\r\nPersonal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures: Wear protective\r\nequipment and keep unprotected personnel away. Ensure adequate ventilation. Remove all sources of\r\nignition. Prevent further leak or spill if safe to do so. For personal protective equipment, please refer to\r\nsection 8.\r\nEnvironmental precautions: Do not let product enter drains, other waterways, or soil.\r\nMethods and materials for containment and cleaning up: Prevent further leak or spill if safe to\r\ndo so. Vacuum, sweep up, or absorb with inert material and place into a suitable disposal container.\r\nConsult local regulations for disposal. See section 13 for further disposal information.\r\n7. Handling and Storage\r\nPrecautions for safe handling: Avoid contact with skin, eyes, and personal clothing. Wash hands\r\nthoroughly after handling. Avoid breathing fumes. Use only with adequate ventilation. Wear suitable\r\nprotective clothing, gloves, and eye/face protection. Keep away from sources of ignition. Minimize dust\r\ngeneration and accumulation. Keep container tightly closed. Open and handle container with care. Do\r\nnot eat, drink, or smoke while handling.\r\nConditions for safe storage, including any incompatibilities: Store in a tightly-closed\r\ncontainer when not in use. Store in a cool, dry, well-ventilated area away from incompatible substances.\r\nKeep away from sources of ignition. ,Store long-term in a cool, dry place.\r\n8. Exposure Controls/Personal Protection\r\nExposure limits:\r\nOSHA PEL: Not available.\r\nNIOSH REL: Not available.\r\nACGIH TLV: Not available.\r\nAppropriate engineering controls: Avoid contact with skin, eyes, and clothing. Wash hands before\r\nbreaks and immediately after handling the product. Facilities storing or utilizing this material should be\r\nequipped with an eyewash fountain. Use adequate general and local exhaust ventilation to keep airborne\r\nconcentrations low.\r\nPersonal protection\r\nEyes: Based on an evaluation of the eye or face hazards present, wear chemical splash-resistant\r\nsafety glasses or goggles with side protection. A face shield may be appropriate in some\r\nworkplaces. Use eyewear tested and approved under appropriate government standards\r\nsuch as OSHA 29 CFR 1910.133 or EU EN166.\r\nAK Scientific, Inc.\r\nSafety Data Sheet (United States)\r\nCalcium hydroxide, ACS, 95.0% min.\r\nPage 2 of 4\r\nHands: Wear gloves selected based on an evaluation of the possible hazards to hands and skin,\r\nthe duration of use, the physical conditions of the workplace, and the chemical resistance\r\nand physical properties of the glove material.\r\nSkin and body: Protective clothing must be selected based on the hazards present in the workplace, the\r\nphysical environment, the duration of exposure, and other factors. No fabric can provide\r\nprotection against all potential hazards; therefore it is important to select the appropriate\r\nprotective clothing for each specific hazard. At the minimum, wear a laboratory coat and\r\nclose-toed footwear.\r\nRespiratory: Respirators are not a substitute for accepted engineering control measures such as\r\nenclosure or confinement of the operation, general and local ventilation, and substitution\r\nof less toxic materials. When respiratory personal protective equipment is appropriate\r\nbased on an assessment of respiratory hazards in the workplace, use a NIOSH- or\r\nCEN-certified respirator.\r\n9.
