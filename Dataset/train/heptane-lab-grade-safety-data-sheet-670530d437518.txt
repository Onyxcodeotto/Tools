General advice
If inhaled Remove to fresh air. Get medical attention. Aspiration into lungs can 
produce severe lung damage. If not breathing, give artificial respiration. Risk 
of serious damage to the lungs (by aspiration).
In case of skin contact                     :Wash off immediately with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes. Get 
medical attention.
In case of eye contact                      :Rinse immediately with plenty of water, also under the eyelids, for at least 15 
minutes. Get medical attention.
If swallowed Do NOT induce vomiting. Call a physician or poison control center 
immediately. If vomiting occurs naturally, have victim lean forward.
4.2 Most important symptoms and effects, both acute and delayed
Difficulty in breathing. Symptoms of overexposure may be headache, dizziness, tiredness, 
nausea, and vomiting.
4.3 Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed
If symptoms persist, call a physician. Treat symptomatically.
SECTION 5: Firefighting measures
5.1 Extinguishing media
Laballey.com Page 4 of 11

alcohol-resistant foam. Water mist maybe used to 
cool closed containers.
Unsuitable extinguishing mediaWater may be ineffective.
5.2 Specific hazards arising from the substance or mixture
Flammable. Risk of ignition. Vapors may form explosive mixtures with air. Vapors may travel 
to source of ignition and flash back. Containers may explode when heated. Do not allow run-
off from fire-fighting to enter drains or water courses. 
Hazardous Combustion Products: Carbon monoxide (CO). Carbon dioxide (CO2).
5.3 Special protective equipment and precautions for firefighters
As in any fire, wear self-contained breathing apparatus pressure-demand, MSHA/NIOSH 
(approved or equivalent) and full protective gear.
