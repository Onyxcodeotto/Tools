Dry chemical powder, carbon \r\ndioxide, sand or earth may be used for small fires \r\nonly.\r\nUnsuitable extinguishing mediaDo not use water jet as an extinguisher, as this will \r\nspread the fire.\r\n5.2 Specific hazards arising from the substance or mixture\r\nVapors may form explosive mixtures with air. Vapors may travel considerable distance to a \r\nsource of ignition and flash back. This product is a poor conductor of electricity and can \r\nbecome electrostatically charged. If sufficient charge is accumulated, ignition of flammable \r\nmixtures can occur. To reduce potential for static discharge, use proper bonding and \r\ngrounding procedures. This liquid may accumulate static electricity when filling properly \r\ngrounded containers. Static electricity accumulation may be significantly increased by the \r\npresence of small quantities of water or other contaminants. Material will float and may ignite \r\non surface of water. During fire, gases hazardous to health may be formed. Combustion \r\nproducts may include: carbon oxides.\r\n5.3 Special protective equipment and precautions for firefighters\r\nIn case of fire and/or explosion do not breathe fumes. Move containers from fire area if you \r\ncan do so without risk. Use water spray to keep fire-exposed containers cool. Self-contained \r\nbreathing apparatus and full protective clothing must be worn in case of fire. Use standard \r\nfirefighting procedures and consider the hazards of other involved materials.\r\n5.4 Further information\r\nFlash Point 79.0 째F (26.1 째C) Closed Cup\r\nAutoignition Temperature 982.4 째F (528 째C)\r\nExplosion limits\r\nLaballey.com Page 5 of 13\r\nUpper 7 % v/v\r\nLower 1.1 % v/v\r\nSensitivity to Mechanical ImpactNo information available.\r\nSensitivity to Static DischargeNo information available.\r\nNFPA\r\nHealth FlammabilityInstabilityPhysical hazards\r\n2 3 0 N/A\r\nSECTION 6: Accidental release measures\r\n6.1 Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures\r\nKeep unnecessary personnel away. Keep people away from and upwind of spill/leak. \r\nEliminate all ignition sources (no smoking, flares, sparks, or flames in immediate area). Wear \r\nappropriate protective equipment and clothing during clean-up. Do not breathe mist or vapor. \r\nDo not touch damaged containers or spilled material unless wearing appropriate protective \r\nclothing. Ventilate closed spaces before entering them. Use appropriate containment to avoid \r\nenvironmental contamination. Transfer by mechanical means such as vacuum truck to a \r\nsalvage tank or other suitable container for recovery or safe disposal. Local authorities should \r\nbe advised if significant spillages cannot be contained. For personal protection, see Section 8 \r\nof the SDS.\r\n6.2 Environmental precautions\r\nAvoid release to the environment. Inform appropriate managerial or supervisory personnel of \r\nall environmental releases. Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. Avoid \r\ndischarge into drains, water courses or onto the ground. Use appropriate containment to avoid \r\nenvironmental contamination.\r\n6.3 Methods and materials for containment and cleaning up\r\nEliminate all ignition sources (no smoking, flares, sparks, or flames in immediate area). Keep \r\ncombustibles (wood, paper, oil, etc.) away from spilled material. Take precautionary measures \r\nagainst static discharge. Use only non-sparking tools. The product is immiscible with water \r\nand will spread on the water surface. Prevent product from entering drains.\r\nLarge Spills: Stop the flow of material, if this is without risk. Dike the spilled material, where \r\nthis is possible. Use a non-combustible material like vermiculite, sand or earth to soak up the \r\nproduct and place into a container for later disposal. Following product recovery, flush area \r\nwith water.\r\nSmall Spills: Absorb with earth, sand or other non-combustible material and transfer to \r\ncontainers for later disposal. Wipe up with absorbent material (e.g. cloth, fleece). Clean \r\nsurface thoroughly to remove residual contamination.\r\nNever return spills to original containers for re-use. Put material in suitable, covered, labeled \r\ncontainers. For waste disposal, see Section 13 of the SDS.\r\n6.4 Reference to other sections\r\nSee Section 2 for full list of hazard and precaution statements. \r\nLaballey.com Page 6 of 13\r\nSECTION 7: Handling and storage\r\n7.1 Precautions for safe handling\r\nPrecautions on safe handling\r\nObtain special instructions before use. Do not handle until all safety precautions have been \r\nread and understood. Do not handle, store or open near an open flame, sources of heat or \r\nsources of ignition. Protect material from direct sunlight. Explosion-proof general and local \r\nexhaust ventilation. Minimize fire risks from flammable and combustible materials (including \r\ncombustible dust and static accumulating liquids) or dangerous reactions with incompatible \r\nmaterials. Handling operations that can promote accumulation of static charges include but \r\nare not limited to: mixing, filtering, pumping at high flow rates, splash filling, creating mists or \r\nsprays, tank and container filling, tank cleaning, sampling, gauging, switch loading, vacuum \r\ntruck operations. Take precautionary measures against static discharges. All equipment used \r\nwhen handling the product must be grounded. Use non-sparking tools and explosion-proof \r\nequipment. Avoid contact with eyes, skin, and clothing. Avoid prolonged exposure. When \r\nusing, do not eat, drink or smoke. Pregnant or breastfeeding women must not handle this \r\nproduct. Should be handled in closed systems, if possible. Wear appropriate personal \r\nprotective equipment. Wash hands thoroughly after handling. Avoid release to the \r\nenvironment. Wash contaminated clothing before reuse. Observe good industrial hygiene \r\npractices.\r\nHygiene measures\r\nObserve any medical surveillance requirements. When using do not smoke. Always observe \r\ngood personal hygiene measures, such as washing after handling the material and before \r\neating, drinking, and/or smoking. Routinely wash work clothing and protective equipment to \r\nremove contaminants.\r\n7.2 Conditions for safe storage, including any incompatibilities\r\nStorage conditions\r\nStore locked up. Keep away from heat, sparks and open flame. Prevent electrostatic charge \r\nbuild-up by using common bonding and grounding techniques. Eliminate sources of ignition. \r\nAvoid spark promoters. Ground/bond container and equipment. These alone may be \r\ninsufficient to remove static electricity. Store in a cool, dry place out of direct sunlight. Store in \r\ntightly closed container. Store in a well-ventilated place. Keep in an area equipped with \r\nsprinklers. Store away from incompatible materials.\r\nIncompatibilities\r\nStrong acids. Strong oxidizing agents.
