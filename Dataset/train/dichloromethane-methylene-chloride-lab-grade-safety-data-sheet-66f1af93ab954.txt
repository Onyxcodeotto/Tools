SECTION 5: Firefighting measures
5.1 Extinguishing media
Suitable extinguishing media Water fog. Carbon dioxide (CO2). Dry chemical. 
Chemical foam.
Unsuitable extinguishing mediaNo information available.
5.2 Specific hazards arising from the substance or mixture
Product is flammable and may be ignited by heat, sparks, flames or other sources of ignition 
(e.g., static electricity, pilot lights or mechanical/electrical equipment). Vapors are heavier than 
air and may accumulate in low areas. Vapors may travel considerable distances to a source of 
ignition where they can ignite, flashback or explode. May create vapor/air explosion hazard 
indoors, outdoors or in sewers. If container is not properly cooled, it can explode in the heat of 
a fire.
5.3 Special protective equipment and precautions for firefighters
Laballey.com Page 4 of 11
Use self‐contained breathing apparatus and full bunker gear in fire areas. Evacuate all 
unprotected personnel from area. Keep containers cool with water fog to minimize swelling 
taking care not to spread flames with water used for cooling.

SECTION 6: Accidental release measures
6.1 Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures
Keep all sources of ignition and hot metal surfaces away from spill or release. Evacuate all 
unprotected personnel from the area.
6.2 Environmental precautions
Prevent liquid from entering drains, sewers, waterways, ground and surface water or soil. 
Contain spill if it can be done with minimal risk.
6.3 Methods and materials for containment and cleaning up
Use foam on spills to minimize vapors. Using only non‐sparking tools and explosion proof 
equipment, collect spill on absorbent material and put into approved container.
6.4 Reference to other sections
See Section 2 for full list of hazard and precaution statements. 
SECTION 7: Handling and storage
7.1 Precautions for safe handling
Precautions on safe handling
Vent container carefully before opening. Empty containers retain residue and/or vapor and 
may be dangerous. Do not cut, weld, braze solder, drill, grind or expose such containers to 
heat, flames, sparks, or other ignition sources. Keep containers tightly closed when not in use. 
Avoid prolonged breathing of mist or vapor. Wash thoroughly after handling.
