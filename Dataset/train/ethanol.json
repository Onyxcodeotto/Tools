Risk of ignition. Vapors may form explosive mixtures with air. Vapors may travel \r\nto source of ignition and flash back. Containers may explode when heated. Thermal \r\ndecomposition can lead to release of irritating gases and vapors. Keep product and empty \r\ncontainer away from heat and sources of ignition. \r\nHazardous Combustion Products: Carbon monoxide (CO), Carbon dioxide (CO2).\r\n5.3 Special protective equipment and precautions for firefighters\r\nLaballey.com Page 4 of 11\r\nIn case of fire and/or explosion, do not breathe fumes. Coordinate firefighting measures to the \r\nfire surroundings. Do not allow firefighting water to enter drains or water courses. Collect \r\ncontaminated firefighting water separately. Fight fire with normal precautions from a \r\nreasonable distance.\r\n5.4 Further information\r\nFlash Point 9.7 °C at 1,013 hPa (ECHA)\r\nAutoignition Temperature 455 °C at 1,013 hPa\r\nExplosion limits\r\nUpper No data available.\r\nLower No data available.\r\nSensitivity to Mechanical ImpactNo information available.\r\nSensitivity to Static DischargeNo information available.\r\nNFPA\r\nHealth FlammabilityInstabilityPhysical hazards\r\n2 3 0 N/A\r\nSECTION 6: Accidental release measures\r\n6.1 Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures\r\nUse personal protective equipment as required.

Wear breathing apparatus if exposed to vapors/dust/aerosols/gases.\r\n6.2 Environmental precautions\r\nKeep away from drains, surface, and ground water. Retain contaminated washing water and \r\ndispose of it.\r\n6.3 Methods and materials for containment and cleaning up\r\nIn case of a spill, cover drains. Wipe up with absorbent material (e.g. cloth, fleece). Collect \r\nspillage: sawdust, kieselgur (diatomite), sand, universal binder. Use of absorbent materials. \r\nPlace in appropriate containers for disposal.

Keep away from sources of ignition. No smoking. Take \r\nprecautionary measures against static discharge. Use only in well-ventilated areas. Due to \r\ndanger of explosion, prevent leakage of vapours into cellars, flues, and ditches. Ground/bond \r\ncontainer and receiving equipment. Use explosion-proof electrical/ventilating/lighting \r\nequipment. Use only non-sparking tools. Places which are not ventilated, e.g. unventilated \r\nbelow ground level areas such as trenches, conduits and shafts, are particularly prone to the \r\npresence of flammable substances or mixtures. Vapors are heavier than air, spread along \r\nfloors and form explosive mixtures with air. \r\nHygiene measures\r\nWash hands after use. Do not eat, drink, and smoke in work areas. Remove contaminated \r\nclothing and protective equipment before entering eating areas. Never keep food or drink in \r\nthe vicinity of chemicals. Never place chemicals in containers that are normally used for food \r\nor drink. Keep away from food, drink, and animal feeding stuffs.\r\n7.2 Conditions for safe storage, including any incompatibilities\r\nStorage conditions\r\nKeep containers tightly closed in a dry, cool, and well-ventilated place.
