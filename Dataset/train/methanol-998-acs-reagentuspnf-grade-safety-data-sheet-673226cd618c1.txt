SECTION 4: First aid measures
4.1 Description of first-aid measures
General advice
If inhaled Remove to fresh air. If breathing is difficult, give oxygen. Do not use mouth-
to-mouth method if victim ingested or inhaled the substance; give artificial 
respiration with the aid of a pocket mask equipped with a one-way valve or 
other proper respiratory medical device. Immediate medical attention is 
required.
In case of skin contact                     :Wash off immediately with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes. Immediate 
medical attention is required.
In case of eye contact                      :Rinse immediately with plenty of water, also under the eyelids, for at least 15 
minutes. Immediate medical attention is required.
If swallowed Do NOT induce vomiting. Call a physician or poison control center 
immediately.
4.2 Most important symptoms and effects, both acute and delayed
Difficulty in breathing. May cause blindness. Inhalation of high vapor concentrations may 
cause symptoms like headache, dizziness, tiredness, nausea, and vomiting.
4.3 Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed
Immediate medical attention is required. Show this safety data sheet to the doctor in 
attendance. Treat symptomatically.
SECTION 5: Firefighting measures
5.1 Extinguishing media
Suitable extinguishing media Water fog. Alcohol-resistant foam. Dry chemical
powder. Carbon dioxide (CO2). 
Laballey.com Page 4 of 11
Unsuitable extinguishing mediaDo not use water jet as an extinguisher, as this will 
spread the fire. 
5.2 Specific hazards arising from the substance or mixture
Vapors may form explosive mixtures with air. Vapors may travel considerable distance to a 
source of ignition and flash back. During fire, gases hazardous to health may be formed. 
Combustion products may include: Carbon oxides.
5.3 Special protective equipment and precautions for firefighters
Self-contained breathing apparatus and full protective clothing must be worn in case of fire. In 
case of fire and/or explosion do not breathe fumes. Move containers from fire area if you can 
do so without risk. Use water spray to keep fire-exposed containers cool.
