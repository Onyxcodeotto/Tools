In case of skin contact                     :Take off immediately all contaminated clothing. Rinse skin with 
water/shower. Get medical advice/attention if you feel unwell. If skin irritation 
occurs: Get medical advice/attention. Wash contaminated clothing before 
reuse.
In case of eye contact                      :Immediately flush eyes with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes. Remove 
contact lenses, if present and easy to do. Continue rinsing. Get medical 
attention if irritation develops and persists.
If swallowed Call a physician or poison control center immediately. Rinse mouth. Do not 
induce vomiting. If vomiting occurs, keep head low so that stomach content 
doesn't get into the lungs.
4.2 Most important symptoms and effects, both acute and delayed
Laballey.com Page 4 of 13
Aspiration may cause pulmonary edema and pneumonitis. Be aware that symptoms of 
chemical pneumonia (shortness of breath) may occur several hours after exposure. May 
cause drowsiness and dizziness. Narcosis. Headache. Nausea, vomiting. Behavioral 
changes. Decrease in motor functions. Irritation of eyes. Exposed individuals may experience 
eye tearing, redness, and discomfort. May cause respiratory irritation. Skin irritation. May 
cause redness and pain. Edema. Jaundice. Prolonged exposure may cause chronic effects.
4.3 Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed
Provide general supportive measures and treat symptomatically. Thermal burns: Flush with 
water immediately. While flushing, remove clothes which do not adhere to affected area. Call 
an ambulance. Continue flushing during transport to hospital. Keep victim warm. Keep victim 
under observation. Symptoms may be delayed.
SECTION 5: Firefighting measures
5.1 Extinguishing media
Suitable extinguishing media Water fog. Foam. Dry chemical powder, carbon 
dioxide, sand or earth may be used for small fires 
only.
Unsuitable extinguishing mediaDo not use water jet as an extinguisher, as this will 
spread the fire.
5.2 Specific hazards arising from the substance or mixture
Vapors may form explosive mixtures with air. Vapors may travel considerable distance to a 
source of ignition and flash back. This product is a poor conductor of electricity and can 
become electrostatically charged. If sufficient charge is accumulated, ignition of flammable 
mixtures can occur. To reduce potential for static discharge, use proper bonding and 
grounding procedures. This liquid may accumulate static electricity when filling properly 
grounded containers. Static electricity accumulation may be significantly increased by the 
presence of small quantities of water or other contaminants. Material will float and may ignite 
on surface of water. During fire, gases hazardous to health may be formed. Combustion 
products may include: carbon oxides.
5.3 Special protective equipment and precautions for firefighters
In case of fire and/or explosion do not breathe fumes. Move containers from fire area if you 
can do so without risk. Use water spray to keep fire-exposed containers cool. Self-contained 
breathing apparatus and full protective clothing must be worn in case of fire. Use standard 
firefighting procedures and consider the hazards of other involved materials.

SECTION 6: Accidental release measures
6.1 Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures
Keep unnecessary personnel away. Keep people away from and upwind of spill/leak. 
Eliminate all ignition sources (no smoking, flares, sparks, or flames in immediate area). Wear 
appropriate protective equipment and clothing during clean-up. Do not breathe mist or vapor. 
Do not touch damaged containers or spilled material unless wearing appropriate protective 
clothing. Ventilate closed spaces before entering them. Use appropriate containment to avoid 
environmental contamination. Transfer by mechanical means such as vacuum truck to a 
salvage tank or other suitable container for recovery or safe disposal. Local authorities should 
be advised if significant spillages cannot be contained. For personal protection, see Section 8 
of the SDS.
6.2 Environmental precautions
Avoid release to the environment. Inform appropriate managerial or supervisory personnel of 
all environmental releases. Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. Avoid 
discharge into drains, water courses or onto the ground. Use appropriate containment to avoid 
environmental contamination.
6.3 Methods and materials for containment and cleaning up
Eliminate all ignition sources (no smoking, flares, sparks, or flames in immediate area). Keep 
combustibles (wood, paper, oil, etc.) away from spilled material. Take precautionary measures 
against static discharge. Use only non-sparking tools. The product is immiscible with water 
and will spread on the water surface. Prevent product from entering drains.
Large Spills: Stop the flow of material, if this is without risk. Dike the spilled material, where 
this is possible. Use a non-combustible material like vermiculite, sand or earth to soak up the 
product and place into a container for later disposal. Following product recovery, flush area 
with water.
Small Spills: Absorb with earth, sand or other non-combustible material and transfer to 
containers for later disposal. Wipe up with absorbent material (e.g. cloth, fleece). Clean 
surface thoroughly to remove residual contamination.
Never return spills to original containers for re-use. Put material in suitable, covered, labeled 
containers. For waste disposal, see Section 13 of the SDS.

SECTION 7: Handling and storage
7.1 Precautions for safe handling
Precautions on safe handling
Obtain special instructions before use. Do not handle until all safety precautions have been 
read and understood. Do not handle, store or open near an open flame, sources of heat or 
sources of ignition. Protect material from direct sunlight. Explosion-proof general and local 
exhaust ventilation. Minimize fire risks from flammable and combustible materials (including 
combustible dust and static accumulating liquids) or dangerous reactions with incompatible 
materials. Handling operations that can promote accumulation of static charges include but 
are not limited to: mixing, filtering, pumping at high flow rates, splash filling, creating mists or 
sprays, tank and container filling, tank cleaning, sampling, gauging, switch loading, vacuum 
truck operations. Take precautionary measures against static discharges. All equipment used 
when handling the product must be grounded. Use non-sparking tools and explosion-proof 
equipment. Avoid contact with eyes, skin, and clothing. Avoid prolonged exposure. When 
using, do not eat, drink or smoke. Pregnant or breastfeeding women must not handle this 
product. Should be handled in closed systems, if possible. Wear appropriate personal 
protective equipment. Wash hands thoroughly after handling. Avoid release to the 
environment. Wash contaminated clothing before reuse. Observe good industrial hygiene 
practices.
Hygiene measures
Observe any medical surveillance requirements. When using do not smoke. Always observe 
good personal hygiene measures, such as washing after handling the material and before 
eating, drinking, and/or smoking. Routinely wash work clothing and protective equipment to 
remove contaminants.
7.2 Conditions for safe storage, including any incompatibilities
Storage conditions
Store locked up. Keep away from heat, sparks and open flame. Prevent electrostatic charge 
build-up by using common bonding and grounding techniques. Eliminate sources of ignition. 
Avoid spark promoters. Ground/bond container and equipment. These alone may be 
insufficient to remove static electricity. Store in a cool, dry place out of direct sunlight. Store in 
tightly closed container. Store in a well-ventilated place. Keep in an area equipped with 
sprinklers. Store away from incompatible materials.
Incompatibilities
Strong acids. Strong oxidizing agents. Halogens.

8.2 Exposure controls
Appropriate engineering controls
Explosion-proof general and local exhaust ventilation. Good general ventilation should be 
used. Ventilation rates should be matched to conditions. If applicable, use process 
enclosures, local exhaust ventilation, or other engineering controls to maintain airborne levels 
below recommended exposure limits. If exposure limits have not been established, maintain 
airborne levels to an acceptable level. Provide eyewash station and safety shower.
Personal protective equipment
Eye/face protection
Chemical goggles are recommended.
Skin protection
