SECTION 6: Accidental release measures
6.1 Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures
No action shall be taken involving any personal risk or without suitable training. Put on 
appropriate personal protective equipment. Do not touch or walk through spilled material. 
Evacuate unnecessary and unprotected personnel. Keep unnecessary and unprotected 
personnel from entering. Provide adequate ventilation. Do not breathe vapors, aerosols. 
Beware of vapors accumulating to form explosive concentrations. Vapors can accumulate in 
low areas.
6.2 Environmental precautions
Prevent product from entering drains. Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. If the 
product contaminates rivers, lakes, or drains, inform respective authorities. 
6.3 Methods and materials for containment and cleaning up
Stop leak if safe to do so. Move containers from spill area. Wash spillages into an effluent 
treatment plant or proceed as follows. Contain spillage, soak up with non-combustible 
absorbent material (e.g. sand, earth, diatomaceous earth, vermiculite) and transfer to a 
container for disposal according to local / national regulations. Dispose of wastes in an 
approved waste disposal facility. Do not allow into the sewerage system, surface waters, 
groundwater, or into the soil. Contaminated absorbent material may pose the same hazard as 
the spilled product.
6.4 Reference to other sections
See Section 2 for full list of hazard and precaution statements. 
SECTION 7: Handling and storage
7.1 Precautions for safe handling
Precautions on safe handling
Avoid inhalation, ingestion, and contact with skin and eyes. Use only with adequate 
ventilation. Remove contaminated clothing and protective equipment before entering eating 
areas. Workers should wash hands and face before eating, drinking, and smoking. Put on 
appropriate personal protection equipment. Eating, drinking, and smoking should be 
prohibited in areas where this material is handled, stored, and processed. 
Hygiene measures
Handle in accordance with good industrial hygiene and safety practice.
7.2 Conditions for safe storage, including any incompatibilities
Laballey.com Page 5 of 10
Storage conditions
Store contents under nitrogen. Store in accordance with local regulations. Store in original 
container protected from direct sunlight in a dry, cool, and well-ventilated area, away from 
incompatible materials, food, and drink. Keep containers sealed until ready for use. 
Containers that have been opened must be carefully resealed and kept upright to prevent 
leakage. Do not store in unlabeled containers. Use appropriate container to avoid 
environmental contamination. Empty containers retain residue and can be dangerous. Do not 
reuse container. Solvent vapors are heavier than air and may spread along floors. 
Incompatibilities
Strong acids and oxidizing agents. Iron. Aluminum.
SECTION 8: Exposure controls/personal protection
8.1 Occupational exposure limits
Contains no substances with occupational exposure limit values. 
8.2 Exposure controls
Appropriate engineering controls
Good general ventilation should be sufficient to control worker exposure to airborne 
contaminants. Ensure that eyewash stations and safety showers are close to the workstation 
location.
Personal protective equipment
Eye/face protection
Chemical resistant goggles must be worn. Faceshield may be necessary in 
operations with splash potential but cannot be used in place of chemical safety 
goggles.
Skin protection
Butyl rubber and fluorinated rubber gloves recommended for hand protection.
Body Protection
Wear suitable protective clothing. Choose body protection according to the 
amount and concentration of the dangerous substance at the work place.
Respiratory protection
Respirator selection must be based on known or anticipated expsoure levels, the 
hazards of the product, and the safe working limits of the selected respirator. 
NIOSH approved, air-purifying organic vapor respirator.
