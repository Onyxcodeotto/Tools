FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES\r\nSuitable Extinguishing Media \r\nWater spray, fog, CO2, dry chemical or alcohol resistant foam. \r\nUnsuitable Extinguishing Media \r\nDo not use a solid water stream as it may scatter and spread fire. \r\nSpecific Hazards In Arising From The Chemical \r\nIrritating and toxic fumes may be produced at high temperatures. Use of water may result if the \r\nformation of a toxic aqueous solution. Do not allow run-off from firefighting to enter drains or \r\nwater courses. Do not use heavy water stream. \r\nExplosive Sensitivity to Mechanical Impact: No \r\nExplosive Sensitivity to Static Discharge: No \r\nSpecial Protective Equipment For Fire Fighters \r\nFirefighters must use standard protective equipment including flame retardant coat, helmet with \r\nface shield, gloves, rubber boots, and in enclosed spaces, SCBA. Structural firefighters \r\nprotective clothing will only provide limited protection. Wear self-contained breathing apparatus \r\nwith a full face-piece operated in the positive pressure demand mode when fighting fires. \r\n6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES\r\nPersonal Precautions Use cautious judgment when cleaning up spill. Wear suitable \r\nprotective clothing, gloves, and eye/face protection. \r\nEnvironmental Precautions Construct a dike to prevent spreading. Keep out of sewers, storm \r\ndrains, surface waters, and soils. \r\nRevision Date: April 10, 2019 \r\nMethods For Containment \r\nSmall Spills: Collect material via broom or mop. Place in tightly sealed \r\ncontainers for proper disposal. \r\nApproach spill areas with caution. \r\nIf liquid was introduced, create a dike or trench to contain material. \r\nSoak up with absorbent material such as clay, sand or other \r\nsuitable non-reactive material. \r\nLarge Spills: Place in leak-proof containers. Seal tightly for proper disposal. \r\nDispose of in accordance with Federal, State, and local hazardous \r\nwaste disposal regulations. \r\n7. HANDLING AND STORAGE\r\nHandling To prevent eye contact under the foreseeable conditions of use, \r\nwear appropriate safety eyewear. When handling, do not eat, \r\ndrink, or smoke. Wash thoroughly after handling. \r\nStorage Technical measures: Keep container closed. \r\nRecommended Storage Conditions: Store in a cool, dry place. \r\nThis material must be stored at room temperature (23 - 25°C).
