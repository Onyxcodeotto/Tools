eye protection, protective gloves, protective clothing. Do not breathe 
dust/fume/gas/mist/vapors/spray. Use only outdoors or in a well-ventilated 
area. Keep cool.
IF INHALED: Remove victim to fresh air and keep at rest in a position 
comfortable for breathing.
IF ON SKIN (or hair): Take off immediately all contaminated clothing. Rinse 
skin with water/shower.
IF IN EYES: Rinse cautiously with water for several minutes. Remove contact 
lenses, if present and easy to do. Continue rinsing. If eye irritation persists: 
get medical advice/attention.

4.1 Description of first-aid measures
General advice
If inhaled If symptoms are experienced, remove source of contamination or move to 
fresh air. If breathing is difficult, get medical attention.
In case of skin contact                     :Take off immediately all contaminated clothing. Rinse skin with 
water/shower. If irritation is experienced, flush with water. Get medical 
attention if irritation develops and persists.
In case of eye contact                      :Immediately flush eyes with water for at least 15 minutes while holding. 
Remove contact lenses, if present and easy to do. Continue rinsing. Get 
medical attention if symptoms persist.
If swallowed Rinse mouth. Do NOT induce vomiting. If the material is swallowed, get 
medical attention or advice.
4.2 Most important symptoms and effects, both acute and delayed
None reasonably foreseeable. Inhalation of high vapor concentrations may cause symptoms 
like headache, dizziness, tiredness, nausea, and vomiting.
4.3 Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed
No information available.
SECTION 5: Firefighting measures
5.1 Extinguishing media
Suitable extinguishing media Water spray, alcohol-resistant foam, BC-powder,
Carbon dioxide (CO2).
Unsuitable extinguishing mediaWater jet.
5.2 Specific hazards arising from the substance or mixture
Flammable. Risk of ignition. Vapors may form explosive mixtures with air. Vapors may travel 
to source of ignition and flash back. Containers may explode when heated. Thermal 
decomposition can lead to release of irritating gases and vapors. Keep product and empty 
container away from heat and sources of ignition. 
Hazardous Combustion Products: Carbon monoxide (CO), Carbon dioxide (CO2).
5.3 Special protective equipment and precautions for firefighters
Laballey.com Page 4 of 11
In case of fire and/or explosion, do not breathe fumes. Coordinate firefighting measures to the 
fire surroundings. Do not allow firefighting water to enter drains or water courses. Collect 
contaminated firefighting water separately. Fight fire with normal precautions from a 
reasonable distance.

SECTION 6: Accidental release measures
6.1 Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures
Use personal protective equipment as required. Ensure adequate ventilation. Remove all
sources of ignition. Take precautionary measures against static discharges. Remove persons 
to safety. Wear breathing apparatus if exposed to vapors/dust/aerosols/gases.
6.2 Environmental precautions
Keep away from drains, surface, and ground water. Retain contaminated washing water and 
dispose of it.
6.3 Methods and materials for containment and cleaning up
In case of a spill, cover drains. Wipe up with absorbent material (e.g. cloth, fleece). Collect 
spillage: sawdust, kieselgur (diatomite), sand, universal binder. Use of absorbent materials. 
Place in appropriate containers for disposal. Ventilate affected area. 
6.4 Reference to other sections
See Section 2 for full list of hazard and precaution statements. 
SECTION 7: Handling and storage
7.1 Precautions for safe handling
Precautions on safe handling
Laballey.com Page 5 of 11
Use local and general ventilation. Keep away from sources of ignition. No smoking. Take 
precautionary measures against static discharge. Use only in well-ventilated areas. Due to 
danger of explosion, prevent leakage of vapours into cellars, flues, and ditches. Ground/bond 
container and receiving equipment. Use explosion-proof electrical/ventilating/lighting 
equipment. Use only non-sparking tools. Places which are not ventilated, e.g. unventilated 
below ground level areas such as trenches, conduits and shafts, are particularly prone to the 
presence of flammable substances or mixtures. Vapors are heavier than air, spread along 
floors and form explosive mixtures with air. 
Hygiene measures
Wash hands after use. Do not eat, drink, and smoke in work areas. Remove contaminated 
clothing and protective equipment before entering eating areas. Never keep food or drink in 
the vicinity of chemicals. Never place chemicals in containers that are normally used for food 
or drink. Keep away from food, drink, and animal feeding stuffs.
7.2 Conditions for safe storage, including any incompatibilities
Storage conditions
Keep containers tightly closed in a dry, cool, and well-ventilated place. Keep away from heat, 
sparks, and flame. Flammables area.
Incompatibilities
Strong oxidizing agents.
